# NadekoBot

Nadeko Discord chatbot written in C# using Discord.net library.  
You might want to join my discord server where i can provide help etc. https://discord.gg/0ehQwTK2RBhxEi0X

##This section will guide you through how to setup NadekoBot from the source code
#### If you want to semi-easily setup the bot, go to [releases](https://github.com/Kwoth/NadekoBot/releases)
After you have cloned this repo, move the libopus and libsodium from the DLLs folder to the bin/debug. And after removing all of Discord.Net's project references, add other dlls from dll folder as a reference. Those are part of the libraries you will need for your project. The other part should resolve after you start the project for the first time.

In your bin/debug folder (or next to your exe), you must have a file called 'credentials.json' in which you will store all the necessary data to make the bot know who the owner is, where to store data, etc.

**This is how the credentials.json should look like:**
```json
{
	"Username":"bot_email",
	"BotMention":"<@bot_id>",
	"Password":"bot_password",
	"GoogleAPIKey":"google_api_key",
	"OwnerID":123123123123,
	"ParseID":"parse_app_id",
	"ParseKey":"parse_api_key",
	"TrelloAppKey": "your_trello_app_key",
	"ForwardMessages": true,
}
```
##### You can omit:  
- Parse keys if you don't want logging  
- googleAPIKey if you don't want music  
- TrelloAppKey if you don't need trello notifications
- ForwardMessages if you don't want bot PM messages to be redirected to you
```json
{
	"Username":"bot_email",
	"BotMention":"<@bot_id>",
	"Password":"bot_password",
	"OwnerID":123123123123,
}
```
- BotMention(bot\_id) and OwnerID are **NOT** names of the owner and the bot. If you do not know the id of your bot, put 2 random numbers in those fields, run the bot and do `.uid @MyBotName` - that will give you your bot\_id, do the same for yourself `.uid @MyName` and copy the numbers in their respective fields.
- For google api key, you need to enable URL shortner and Youtube video search in the dev console.
- For **ParseID** and **ParseKey**, you need to register on http://www.parse.com, get those values and create an app with these 3 classes: `'CommandsRan', 'Requests' and 'Stats'` in order to make the logging work.
- If you have **Windows7**, you need to install [Parse.Api](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Parse.Api/) instead of the library that comes with this project
- If you want to have music, you need to download FFMPEG from this link http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ (static build version) and add ffmpeg/bin folder to your PATH environment variable. You do that by opening explorer -> right click 'This PC' -> properties -> advanced system settings -> In the top part, there is a PATH field, add `;` to the end and then your ffmpeg install location /bin (for example ;C:\ffmpeg-5.6.7\bin) and save. Open command prompt and type ffmpeg to see if you added it correctly. If it says "command not found" then you made a mistake somewhere. There are a lot of guides on the internet on how to add stuff to your PATH, check them out if you are stuck.

Download [this folder](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=54172283263968075500) which contains images and add it next to your .exe in order to make the $draw, $flip, rip and similar functions work.

You should replace nadeko's image with the image of your bot in order to make the hide/unhide commands work as intended.
You should **remove** Discord.Net projects from your solution, and use DLLs instead, as instructed above.  

**You are all set.**
Fire up visual studio, wait for it to resolve dependencies and start NadekoBot.

Enjoy
